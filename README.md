# custom cpp float library

### what was done

I tried to implement all functionality that was offered, however some things don't work correctly, and I didn't mange to fix them. There is code for everything and you can check if the idea was correct.
Especially sin, cos, tan and log funtions should have been working correctly if previous functionality was working, as thay use Tailor sums, which are easy to implements. Pow also would be correct if division gave ok results. Operators, addition and substaction at least are completely fine.
